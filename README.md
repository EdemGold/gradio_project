# Gradio Project
This project is for an article I wrote about the gradio library.

It contains a neural network trained on dianetes data and also a GUI web app created using gradio which let's users inut their data (according to the features in the dataset) and the data is then run through the model which then outputs if the person has diabetes or not.
